Hi 👋! I'm Rakshi (he/him), a sophomore at Tufts University pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. 
I'm passionate about web development and love creating beautiful, functional applications. 
When I'm not coding, you can find me playing tennis 🎾, going to the gym 💪, 
listening to the Weeknd and Tate McRae 🎵, watching Bollywood and Kollywood 🎥, learning 
[Finnish](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/rakshi2006), and learning the flute 🪈.

I'm a Congressional App Challenge winner 🏆. Check out
